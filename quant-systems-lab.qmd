The **Quant Systems Lab** is a long-term initiative by **myself** to unify control theory, finance, and risk management into one coherent teaching ecosystem.
Its purpose is to help professionals from both domains understand how modern markets can be modelled, stabilised, and optimised using system-thinking principles.
The Lab will evolve as part of the [Quant with Vahab](https://quantwithvahab.com) platform — starting with simulation-driven online courses and expanding into advanced research modules, publications, and real-world trading systems.
Each track builds a bridge between disciplines: 

- engineers learning finance, 
- finance professionals learning control, and 
- advanced learners integrating both into deployable quantitative systems.


# **Teaching Roadmap Overview**

*(Quant Systems Lab — Draft v2, October 2025)*


The **Teaching Roadmap** outlines the structure and evolution of the *Quant Systems Lab* learning ecosystem.
It presents a clear progression from conceptual understanding to applied implementation, bridging the gap between control theory and financial practice.
Each track targets a specific audience but contributes to a unified framework — empowering learners to model, simulate, and control risk across financial systems.
Together, they form the foundation of a **quantitative education platform built on engineering precision and financial insight**.



| Track | Audience              | Title                                                 | Tagline                                                                   |

| 1     | Engineers to Finance   | **Finance for Control Engineers**                     | *Learn to see markets as dynamic systems and design stability in wealth.* |
| 2     | Finance to Engineering | **Control Engineering for Finance Professionals**     | *Master feedback, stability, and robustness to manage financial risk.*    |

## **TRACK 1**

> - **Title:** *Finance for Engineers: From Control Systems to Financial Thinking*
> - **Goal:** help engineers translate system intuition into financial reasoning.


This track helps engineers translate their intuition about systems, stability, and feedback into the language of finance.
It introduces financial markets as dynamic processes, portfolios as controllable systems, and risk as measurable noise.
Through practical coding, simulation, and optimisation, learners discover how familiar engineering principles — such as feedback control and model predictive control — can guide disciplined investment decisions.
By the end, engineers will see finance not as speculation, but as **applied system design under uncertainty**.




### **Course 1A**

> - **Title:** *Finance for Control Engineers*
> - **Tagline:** *Think of finance as a feedback system — where portfolios evolve like dynamic processes.*

This course introduces engineers to the structure and behaviour of financial systems through the lens of control theory.
It replaces abstract financial jargon with familiar system concepts — states, inputs, feedback, and stability.
Learners explore how portfolios evolve dynamically, how risk behaves like noise, and how optimisation shapes decisions under uncertainty.
By the end, participants will see **finance as a controllable system** — measurable, predictable, and open to design.
