## Abstract
Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. 
A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. 
This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. 
We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. 
The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure.
Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.

> Anchored state-space approach for stable lifetime PD; less drift, less procyclicality. Code and full reproducibility.
