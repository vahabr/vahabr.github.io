I’ve just refreshed my [**Publications**](../publications.html) page. — it’s now fully up to date with my recent journal articles, conference papers, and book contributions.

The list is organised by category and year, with the most recent work at the top. 
My aim is to make it easier for colleagues, collaborators, and students to browse my research across energy systems, optimisation, and quantitative risk management.

You can explore the page here: \[link to your publications page]
