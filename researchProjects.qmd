My research focuses on the interface of **stochastic modelling, optimisation, and control**, applied to large-scale systems such as **energy infrastructures** and **financial networks**. A central theme is understanding how uncertainty propagates through complex, interconnected structures, and how rigorous mathematical design can mitigate risk while improving stability, interpretability, and efficiency.

The projects presented here reflect this perspective. They range from methodological advances in stochastic and distributed control to domain-driven applications in smart energy systems, credit risk, and emerging financial technologies. Together, they outline a trajectory that connects theoretical innovation with practical impact across critical infrastructures.

## Current Research Focus


### Scenario Convexification of Stochastic Nonconvex Programs

**Description**  

This project addresses one of the central difficulties in stochastic optimisation: **nonconvex programmes with chance or expectation constraints**. Such problems arise naturally in energy, finance, and engineering applications, yet their scenario approximations often suffer from looseness and unpredictable duality gaps.  

We reformulate the scenario problem using a **set-valued perspective**, where feasibility is represented as the **Minkowski sum** of per-scenario sets. By combining Aumann expectations with a **law of large numbers for random sets**, we establish convergence properties of these sums. Applying a **Shapley‚ÄìFolkman convexification argument**, we derive explicit bounds on the duality gap.  

For **chance-constrained problems**, the duality gap is shown to be uniformly bounded by a constant depending only on dimension. For **expectation-constrained problems**, the gap vanishes at rate *O(1/N)* with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate these asymptotic behaviours and reveal the distinct roles of chance versus expectation constraints in shaping feasible regions.  

**Research significance**  

These results offer one of the first rigorous analyses of **scenario methods in nonconvex optimisation**. They demonstrate that despite nonconvexity, scenario approximations can achieve provable stability, either through bounded or vanishing duality gaps. This advances the mathematical foundations of **risk-aware optimisation** with implications for portfolio design, energy systems, and engineering control.  



* **Theme:** Stochastic optimisation, scenario methods, convexification  
* **Institution:** Joint work with Akiko Takeda (University of Tokyo) and Takafumi Kanamori (Institute of Science Tokyo)  
* **Status:** In preparation for submission to *SIAM Journal on Optimization (SIOPT)*  
* **Keywords:** Duality gap, random sets, Shapley‚ÄìFolkman theorem, chance constraints, expectation constraints  



**Outcomes**  

* Introduced a **scenario convexification framework** for analysing stochastic nonconvex programmes.  
* Derived **dimension-dependent uniform bounds** for chance-constrained problems.  
* Proved **vanishing duality gaps** for expectation-constrained problems with rate *O(1/N)*.  
* Provided numerical evidence supporting theoretical asymptotics.  

**Highlighted outputs**  

* Working paper: *Vanishing Duality Gap in Uncertain Nonconvex Problems* (with A. Takeda and T. Kanamori).

### Anchored Kalman Filtering for Lifetime PD

**Description**  

Lifetime probability of default (PD) estimation is central to credit impairment modelling under IFRS 9 and CECL. A recurring challenge is that macroeconomic forecast errors accumulate when projecting transition matrices over long horizons, leading to volatile and procyclical PD term structures.  

This project reformulates the problem in a **state‚Äìspace framework**, where term structure dynamics are estimated with a Kalman filter. We show that the standard filter leaves non-vanishing variability, failing to stabilise long-run PD paths. To address this, we introduce an **anchored observation model** that incorporates a neutral long-run economic state into the filtering process. This adjustment ensures **asymptotic stochastic stability**, providing convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure.  


**Research significance**  

This project advances the reliability of **credit risk modelling under IFRS 9 and CECL** by addressing one of its core weaknesses: unstable and procyclical lifetime PD term structures. By embedding PD estimation in a state‚Äìspace framework and introducing anchored observation models, the work provides a mathematically rigorous solution that ensures **stochastic stability**. Beyond theory, the approach directly supports banks and regulators in producing smoother, more interpretable projections of credit risk, reducing model risk and enhancing comparability across economic cycles.  



* **Theme:** Credit risk, IFRS 9 / CECL, model stability  
* **Institution:** Independent research (in collaboration with industry applications)  
* **Status:** Working paper, simulation package, GitHub repository  
* **Keywords:** Risk modelling, stochastic stability, state‚Äìspace methods

## Past Research Projects

### ERSAS ‚Äî Energy System Integration ‚Äî Postdoc Project


**Description**

The ERSAS project (*Efficient, Reliable, Sustainable and Socially Acceptable Energy System Integration*) developed new approaches to the coordinated operation of electricity, gas, and heat networks. The central idea was that multi-carrier infrastructures ‚Äî such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, hybrid heat pumps, Power-to-Gas, and Gas-to-Power conversion ‚Äî can significantly improve efficiency and flexibility if supported by the right control strategies and market mechanisms.

My work focused on mathematical modelling, stochastic optimisation, and distributed control design. I studied how uncertainty in renewable generation and end-user demand propagates across coupled infrastructures, and how incentive schemes and control algorithms can align decentralised actors with system-level goals. This included developing model predictive control (MPC) formulations that balance flexibility, efficiency, and reliability, while explicitly accounting for financial and operational risks.

* **Theme:** Electricity‚Äìgas‚Äìheat coupling, incentives, and control
* **Institution:** University of Groningen (with partners: Alliander, Enexis, TNO)
* **Funding:** Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)
* **Period:** Sep 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2019

**Outcomes:**

* Demonstrated how coupling gas and electricity systems can improve integration of renewable energy while maintaining security of supply.
* Proposed stochastic MPC frameworks with risk measures (e.g., CVaR) to better manage demand flexibility under uncertainty.
* Designed distributed algorithms for building-to-grid integration and frequency support services.
* Provided simulation tools to evaluate multi-carrier energy scenarios, supporting both academic and industrial partners.

### ATES-SG ‚Äî Smart Thermal Grids with Aquifer Storage ‚Äî PhD Project

**Description** 

ATES-SG studied how **Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES)** can be scaled in dense urban districts while maintaining efficiency and minimising interference between neighbouring systems. We modelled interactions among hot/cold wells, uncertain heat-cooling demand, and conversion assets to design **distributed MPC** and planning tools that coordinate operation at district scale. The work connected subsurface physics with network-level control and market incentives, showing how seasonal storage can reduce emissions and peak loads when orchestrated with building and grid objectives.

* **Theme:** Urban energy and seasonal storage  
* **Institution:** Delft University of Technology (with Waternet, Provincie Noord-Holland, Tauw BV, STW/TTW, Priva, DWA)  
* **Funding:** Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)  
* **Period:** Sep 2014 ‚Äì Aug 2018  


**Outcomes**  

* Frameworks for **distributed energy management** of multiple ATES sites under uncertainty.  
* Evidence that coordination mitigates thermal interference, improving seasonal performance factors.  
* MPC formulations linking **building comfort**, storage dynamics, and market signals.

## Applied Research & Entrepreneurial Initiatives



### ZWMCo ‚Äî Tokenised Hedge Fund with DeFi Risk Framework

**Description**  

ZWMCo explores how **quantitative risk modelling** can be embedded into decentralised finance. The project envisions a tokenised hedge fund where investors contribute to a managed pool and receive a native token representing their share. Unlike many existing DeFi products, ZWMCo emphasises **transparent risk management**, leveraging methods from quantitative finance such as **liquidity stress testing, stochastic control, and scenario analysis**.  

The system integrates two main components:  

* **Algorithmic trading (AVS-based)**: A suite of strategies built on *Adaptive Volatility Scaling (AVS)* principles. These strategies dynamically adjust exposure across crypto assets, balancing risk and return under changing volatility regimes.  
* **LSDx framework**: A research-driven risk and pricing model for **liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)**. The framework establishes valuation signals, stability bounds, and margin rules to reduce systemic fragility in LSD markets, providing an institutional-grade lens for DeFi liquidity products.  


**Research significance**  

ZWMCo illustrates how academic expertise in **stochastic modelling, optimisation, and risk pooling** can extend into **Web3 ecosystems**. By combining **AVS-based algorithmic trading** with an **LSDx valuation framework**, the project bridges quantitative finance with decentralised tokenomics, offering a path to sustainable, risk-aware DeFi investing.  

**Theme:** Decentralised finance, algorithmic trading, liquidity risk  
**Institution:** Independent initiative (Zillions Wealth Management Co.)  
**Status:** Concept development, white paper drafting, prototype trading bot  
**Keywords:** DeFi, staking derivatives, risk management, tokenisation  


**Outcomes** 

* Drafted a **technical white paper** on LSDx risk and pricing frameworks.

### ChargePool ‚Äî Behavioural Energy Pricing for EV Charging


**Description**  

ChargePool tackles one of the major challenges for electric vehicle adoption: the **uncertainty and volatility of charging costs**. The project builds on my expertise in stochastic optimisation and risk pooling to design a system where EV users can ‚Äúlock in‚Äù charging prices over a future horizon. By aggregating user demand and leveraging hedging strategies, the platform provides predictable energy costs while balancing risk across the pool.  

The innovation lies in **combining behavioural modelling with financial risk techniques**: users interact through a simple app, but underneath, advanced optimisation allocates risk, manages variability, and aligns incentives. Beyond pricing, ChargePool also integrates **route planning, station availability, and points of interest**, turning EV charging into a more seamless mobility experience.  


**Research significance**  

ChargePool represents a direct application of stochastic modelling and incentive design to **consumer-facing energy systems**. By bridging academic methods and entrepreneurial deployment, it illustrates how optimisation and risk management can create **new markets for flexibility and predictability** in the energy transition.  


**Theme:** Energy systems, behavioural economics, pricing optimisation  
**Institution:** Independent initiative (with prospective industry partners in Switzerland)  
**Status:** Proof-of-concept (submitted for BRIDGE funding), prototype app in development  
**Keywords:** EV charging, risk pooling, smart pricing, behavioural modelling  


**Outcomes**  

* Designed a **risk pooling engine** that stabilises charging costs for users.  
* Developed a **prototype app** for route planning and charging station selection.  
* Submitted a **BRIDGE Proof-of-Concept proposal** hosted at ETH Z√ºrich (Automatic Control Lab).
