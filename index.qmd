## About me


I am a researcher, quantitative analyst, and entrepreneur with a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and society. My background spans both **academic research** and **financial industry practice**, giving me a unique perspective on how rigorous theory can be transformed into practical solutions for real-world challenges.

I hold a **PhD in Applied Mathematics and Control Systems Engineering** from Delft University of Technology, where I focused on optimisation, stochastic modelling, and distributed control of large-scale systems such as energy and infrastructure networks. After my PhD, I continued as a **Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Groningen**, where my work centred on advanced methods in optimisation, learning, and decision-making in uncertain environments.

In parallel to my academic career, I have spent the last **five years as a Senior Quantitative Analyst in banking**, working at leading financial institutions in Zürich and Amsterdam. My focus has been on **model risk management, credit and impairment modelling, and regulatory compliance frameworks** such as IFRS 9, CECL, and stress testing. This experience has strengthened my ability to build bridges between advanced mathematical models, regulatory expectations, and practical business needs.

Today, my research and professional interests converge around **stochastic modelling, optimisation, and risk management** across domains such as **energy systems, financial markets, and infrastructure planning**. I am particularly driven by the question of how **mathematical models, data-driven methods, and economic principles** can be combined to design **robust, transparent, and scalable decision frameworks** for uncertain and dynamic environments.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy building new ideas into projects, from **smart energy applications for electric vehicles** to **risk and pricing frameworks for decentralised finance**. At heart, I am motivated by curiosity, collaboration, and the ambition to create tools that not only solve technical problems but also contribute to more resilient systems for the future.
