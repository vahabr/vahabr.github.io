## Overview

My research combines **stochastic modelling, optimisation, and control** with applications in **energy systems** and **financial risk**. I study how uncertainty propagates through complex infrastructures and how mathematical design can make them more stable, interpretable, and efficient.  
This page highlights **selected projects** — past, current, and future — that illustrate this trajectory.

## Current Projects

### Anchored Kalman Filtering for Lifetime PD
**Theme:** Credit risk, IFRS 9 / CECL, model stability  
**Summary:** Reformulating lifetime probability of default (PD) estimation in a state–space framework. Anchored observation models reduce procyclicality and deliver smoother term structures.  
**Status:** Working paper, simulation package, GitHub repo.  
**Keywords:** risk modelling, stochastic stability, state–space methods

### ERSAS — Energy System Integration
**Theme:** Electricity–gas–heat coupling, incentives and control  
**Summary:** Integrated modelling of multi-carrier energy systems with flexible conversion (CHP, PtG/GtP). Focus on designing control and market mechanisms that align decentralised agents with system-level efficiency.  
**Role:** Mathematical methods, simulation, incentive design  
**Partners:** ETH Zürich, TU Delft, industry collaborators

### ATES-SG — Smart Thermal Grids with Aquifer Storage
**Theme:** Urban energy & storage  
**Summary:** Distributed control and planning for **Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES)** in dense urban districts. Investigated how seasonal storage interacts with heating/cooling demand and market incentives.  
**Role:** Postdoctoral researcher, optimisation & distributed MPC  
**Partners:** ETH Zürich, NWO, KWR, industry utilities

## Future Directions

### LSDx — A Quantitative Intelligence Layer for Liquid Staking Derivatives
**Theme:** DeFi risk and pricing  
**Vision:** A modelling and pricing framework for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Emphasis on risk-adjusted valuation, slashing/depeg risk, and allocation strategies.  
**Output:** Technical white paper, prototype simulations

---

### Opttera — Energy Pricing Platform
**Theme:** Behavioural pricing, risk pooling for EV charging  
**Vision:** Enable EV users to stabilise charging costs via collective risk-pooling and smart contracts. Builds on behavioural modelling and stochastic hedging of energy costs.  
**Status:** Entrepreneurial spin-out in development, linked to prior research on energy systems optimisation.
