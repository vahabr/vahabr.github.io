I have contributed as instructor and teaching assistant in lectures, tutorials, and project-based assignments, with responsibilities ranging from exercise design and student supervision to grading and symposium organisation. These activities allowed me to combine theoretical insights with hands-on problem solving, while engaging closely with MSc students in engineering and systems control.\nIn addition to my past university teaching, I am developing a series of online courses in my areas of expertise — with especial focus on quantitative and financial risk and algorithmic tradings. These courses will soon be available to a broader audience interested in applying rigorous methods to complex, uncertain systems."

    "text": "About me\nI am a researcher, quantitative analyst, and entrepreneur with a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and society. My background spans both academic research and financial industry practice, giving me a unique perspective on how rigorous theory can be transformed into practical solutions for real-world challenges.\nI hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Control Systems Engineering from Delft University of Technology, where I focused on optimisation, stochastic modelling, and distributed control of large-scale systems such as energy and infrastructure networks. After my PhD, I continued as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Groningen, where my work centred on advanced methods in optimisation, learning, and decision-making in uncertain environments.\nIn parallel to my academic career, I have spent the last five years as a Senior Quantitative Analyst in banking, working at leading financial institutions in Zürich and Amsterdam. My focus has been on model risk management, credit and impairment modelling, and regulatory compliance frameworks such as IFRS 9, CECL, and stress testing. This experience has strengthened my ability to build bridges between advanced mathematical models, regulatory expectations, and practical business needs.\nToday, my research and professional interests converge around stochastic modelling, optimisation, and risk management across domains such as energy systems, financial markets, and infrastructure planning. I am particularly driven by the question of how mathematical models, data-driven methods, and economic principles can be combined to design robust, transparent, and scalable decision frameworks for uncertain and dynamic environments.\nBeyond my professional work, I enjoy building new ideas into projects, from smart energy applications for electric vehicles to risk and pricing frameworks for decentralised finance. At heart, I am motivated by curiosity, collaboration, and the ambition to create tools that not only solve technical problems but also contribute to more resilient systems for the future."

    "text": "Highlights\n\nScenario Convexification of Nonconvex Uncertain Programs\n\nMy recent work introduces convexification techniques that bridge theory and computation in nonconvex uncertain optimisation problems. The approach demonstrates how scenario-based approximations can make otherwise intractable models both solvable and practically relevant. This research contributes to the understanding of duality gaps, tractability, and robust decision-making under uncertainty — with applications in portfolio selection and large-scale systems.\n\nLifetime Probability of Default and Kalman Filtering Approaches\n\nIn financial risk management, I have developed methodologies for modelling lifetime probability of default (PD), incorporating Kalman filtering techniques to enhance estimation under uncertainty. This work addresses regulatory requirements (IFRS 9, CECL) while providing more stable and transparent credit risk measures. It reflects my broader interest in connecting stochastic state-space models with practical risk assessment frameworks used in banking.\n\nBook Project: Quantitative Interview Questions (QIQ)\n\nI am authoring a book that brings together quantitative finance, probability, and statistics into a practical guide for professionals preparing for technical interviews. The book combines rigorous exercises with clear explanations, covering topics from risk modelling and stochastic processes to applied coding tasks. My aim is to create not just a collection of questions, but a structured learning resource that builds both technical mastery and intuition."

    "section": "Chapters Summary",
    "text": "Chapters Summary\n\nChapter 1: Bill and Me\n\nHighlight: The purpose of life is not to be happy. The purpose of life is to be useful.\nJim Collins opens the book with a heartfelt reflection on his friendship and intellectual partnership with Bill Lazier, co-author of the original Beyond Entrepreneurship. Far from being just a professional collaborator, Lazier was Collins’ mentor, a moral compass, and an enduring example of what it means to lead with character. The chapter is a personal tribute, but also a profound philosophical statement: at the core of great leadership lies not brilliance or ambition, but decency, trustworthiness, and humility.\nThrough anecdotes and quiet observations, Collins illustrates the depth of Bill’s influence. Lazier believed that the greatest currency in business — and in life — is trust. He practiced what he preached, consistently treating others with generosity and respect, even when it cost him personally. Collins credits Lazier with shaping many of the principles that would later become famous in Good to Great and Built to Last, particularly the emphasis on people, values, and long-term integrity over short-term gains.\nThe chapter establishes a central idea: great businesses are built by great people, and great people are shaped by their values, not their titles or credentials. Collins makes clear that this book — BE 2.0 — is not merely an update of a classic, but a deeply personal continuation of a shared legacy. “The purpose of life,” Lazier once told him, “is not to be happy. The purpose of life is to be useful.” That sentiment echoes through the entire book.\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Great Vision Without Great People Is Irrelevant\n\nHighlight: If you have the right people, the problem of how to motivate and manage largely goes away.\nIn this chapter, Collins delivers one of his core convictions: that the quality of your people is more important than the brilliance of your vision. A company with an extraordinary vision but the wrong people will fail. A company with average strategy but extraordinary people has a real chance at greatness. This concept, which he later famously summarised as “first who, then what,” emphasises that effective leaders should prioritise assembling the right team before finalising strategy, direction, or product plans.\nCollins urges leaders to ask themselves a simple but powerful question: “Would you hire this person again?” If the answer is no, it’s a sign to act — not necessarily by firing immediately, but by being honest about fit. The right people are not only competent, but also aligned in values, self-motivated, and capable of growing with the organisation. They don’t require constant supervision. Conversely, the wrong people, no matter how talented, create drag — they weaken the culture, confuse the mission, and drain leadership energy.\nImportantly, Collins warns against a common mistake: tolerating mediocrity out of loyalty. Just because someone has been with the company since the beginning doesn’t mean they should stay. Companies that scale with discipline make tough people decisions early. Letting a mismatched team member stay in a key seat can be more damaging than any strategic misstep.\nThe chapter also discusses the danger of keeping “clever but toxic” individuals. High performance is not enough if the behaviour erodes trust or undermines others. A strong culture is not built by a few top performers — it is built by consistency of values across the organisation. In short, leaders must view talent not as a transaction, but as a cultural foundation.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Leadership Style\n\nHighlight: Your leadership style is not what you say it is. It’s what you do consistently, even when no one is watching.\nIn this chapter, Collins examines the subtle but critical difference between managing people and leading a culture. The most effective leaders, he argues, don’t impose control — they create the conditions in which people naturally operate with discipline, creativity, and accountability. Leadership, in this sense, is not about style in a superficial or performative way. It’s about what you repeatedly do, what you tolerate, and what you reward — because over time, that becomes your culture.\nThe chapter dismantles the myth of the charismatic, top-down leader. While charisma can inspire short bursts of motivation, it doesn’t scale. What scales is consistency. Collins highlights the power of “clock-building,” a metaphor for creating a self-sustaining, values-driven organisation that runs well without you. Great leaders focus not on being indispensable, but on building systems, people, and processes that are.\nCollins introduces several dimensions of leadership that go beyond traditional “styles” like authoritarian vs participative. He emphasises Level 5 Leadership — a concept expanded in Good to Great — which blends personal humility with fierce resolve. These leaders aren’t loud, but they are unwavering. They’re not the centre of attention, but they set a tone that permeates the organisation. Importantly, they take responsibility for failure and give credit for success.\nAnother key idea is that leaders shape culture through their behavioural example — how they show up in meetings, how they react to bad news, how they listen (or don’t), how they respond under stress. You can’t fake your culture. If you preach values but act contrary to them, people will follow what you do, not what you say.\nFinally, Collins makes a clear distinction between leadership as personality versus leadership as responsibility. True leadership is not about style points — it’s about being the one who takes ownership of creating a culture of excellence and discipline, even when it’s hard or unpopular.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Vision\n\nHighlight: A vision is not what you hope to become. A vision is what you are willing to suffer for.\nThis chapter is the philosophical centre of Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0. Collins argues that vision is not a statement — it’s a living system of meaning that drives everything in a company: decisions, culture, strategy, behaviour. A powerful vision doesn’t simply hang on a wall or get recited in meetings. It clarifies why your organisation exists, what you refuse to compromise, and what you’re daring to become.\nCollins breaks down vision into three essential components: core values, core purpose, and BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals). Core values are the non-negotiables — behaviours and principles that you hold onto even when they cost you. He’s quick to note that values don’t need to be universal; they just need to be authentic and lived. Some companies value innovation, others discipline, others humility. What matters is that the values are real and visible in daily actions.\nCore purpose, meanwhile, answers the deeper question: “Why do we exist?” It’s not about profit or growth — those are outcomes. Purpose is the organisation’s reason for being that goes beyond money. When a company loses its purpose, it may still function, but it becomes hollow. Collins compares this to a body without a soul: technically alive, but lacking spirit.\nFinally, BHAGs are long-term, ambitious goals — clear, compelling targets that inspire people to stretch far beyond incremental progress. A good BHAG is audacious but not reckless, emotionally engaging, and measurable enough to know when you’ve achieved it. Importantly, BHAGs work only when they’re grounded in a deep understanding of what your organisation can be great at.\nThroughout the chapter, Collins reinforces that vision isn’t about sounding good — it’s about alignment. The best companies have congruence between what they say, what they believe, and what they do. Vision becomes powerful when it’s operational — when hiring decisions, performance reviews, product choices, and even budget cuts are driven by it.\nThis chapter challenges leaders to get honest: Is your vision just branding language? Or is it a disciplining force in the organisation? Do your people know it? Live it? Care about it? If not, the problem isn’t the words — it’s the leadership behind them.\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Luck Favors the Persistent\n\nHighlight: Luck is not a plan. Discipline is.\nIn this chapter, Collins tackles the seductive myth that success in business is mostly a matter of good luck — being in the right place at the right time, having the right investor, catching the right market wave. He doesn’t deny that luck exists. In fact, he admits that every great entrepreneur benefits from luck in some form. But he sharply distinguishes between getting luck and returning luck with discipline, preparation, and grit. What ultimately separates those who build enduring companies from those who don’t is not how much luck they get — it’s how they respond to the luck they receive.\nCollins introduces the idea of the “Return on Luck” (ROL) — a concept borrowed from Great by Choice. Two companies might receive the same stroke of luck (a booming market, a competitor imploding, a regulatory tailwind), but one seizes it and amplifies it through disciplined action, while the other squanders it or becomes complacent. In other words, luck is a variable — not a strategy. The entrepreneurs who endure are those who show up every day, stay the course during uncertainty, and are always ready to turn a lucky break into a breakthrough.\nThe chapter features examples of companies and founders who weren’t just lucky — they were relentless. They worked longer, studied harder, failed more often, and got back up faster than others. Collins makes it clear that luck can catalyse a result, but it’s persistence that compounds outcomes over time. He urges readers to build a culture of grit — one where effort, resilience, and preparation are valued as highly as intelligence or creativity.\nHe also issues a warning: people who attribute their failures to bad luck often lack the self-awareness or discipline to grow. Great leaders reflect on their own role in missed opportunities. They ask, “Did we prepare well enough?” or “Did we execute fast enough?” instead of blaming external forces. The best companies track their lucky and unlucky events — and how they responded — as part of their learning culture.\nUltimately, this chapter is about rejecting the lottery mentality and embracing the grind. Enduring greatness is rarely the result of one lucky moment. It is the result of ten thousand unsexy decisions, made with consistency, that put you in a position to benefit when luck finally knocks.\n\n\n\nChapter 6: What Makes Great Companies Tick – The Map\n\nHighlight: The great companies are not built by one thing done right — they are built by a system of interlocking concepts executed with relentless consistency.\nIn this pivotal chapter, Collins introduces what he calls The Map — a unifying framework that outlines the essential elements behind all great, enduring companies. The purpose of the chapter is to synthesis the ideas explored in earlier chapters into a coherent, visual and conceptual system. Collins wants readers to stop thinking in isolated traits or silver bullets, and instead understand how the pieces of greatness connect and reinforce each other.\nAt the centre of the map is the idea that greatness comes not from any single variable — not vision, not leadership, not innovation — but from the dynamic interplay of several foundational elements. These include: Level 5 Leadership, First Who, Then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, The Hedgehog Concept, A Culture of Discipline, The Flywheel, Preserve the Core / Stimulate Progress, and Clock Building. Each of these becomes a point on the map — not steps in a process, but interconnected disciplines that reinforce long-term excellence.\nWhat makes the map powerful is its universality. Collins argues that companies of vastly different industries, sizes, and stages can build greatness by adhering to this framework. The elements don’t rely on specific tactics, tools, or technologies. They are principles, and as such, they are durable. Moreover, they are cumulative — organisations don’t become great by mastering one of these principles. They become great by compounding them together, over time, with consistency.\nA central concept here is that of “clock building, not time telling” — the idea that great leaders focus on building enduring systems and cultures, rather than being individual geniuses with one great idea. Similarly, preserve the core and stimulate progress reminds readers that great companies hold tightly to their foundational values, but aggressively evolve everything else to remain relevant and effective.\nThe map is not a checklist or a how-to guide. It’s a way of thinking — a framework for diagnosing the health and direction of your organisation. Collins encourages leaders to ask: Where are we strong? Where are we weak? Which of these disciplines have we truly embedded? Which are only surface-level?\nUltimately, the map serves as a navigation tool — not for finding quick wins, but for building a company that can endure, adapt, and thrive for decades.\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Strategy\n\nHighlight: A great strategy is as much about what you don’t do as what you choose to pursue.\nIn this chapter, Collins takes direct aim at the mystique of strategy as a high-concept, consultant-driven exercise. He argues that great strategy is not clever — it’s clear. It is not about crafting complex plans or elegant frameworks. Rather, it is about making deliberate choices, grounded in brutal facts, that align with your core values and long-term goals. The hallmark of a strong strategy is not how “smart” it looks on paper, but how actionable it is in practice — and how well it guides decision-making throughout the organisation.\nCollins re-emphasises the importance of what he calls the Hedgehog Concept, introduced in Good to Great. A great strategy sits at the intersection of three things: what you can be the best in the world at, what you are deeply passionate about, and what drives your economic engine. Companies that thrive in the long term are those that define this intersection with brutal honesty — and then commit to it with discipline. Those that fail often chase shiny objects, pivot endlessly, or confuse ambition with focus.\nA key insight in this chapter is that strategy is about saying no. Collins believes that most strategic failures are not due to poor thinking but to a lack of strategic constraint. In other words, companies get distracted. They pursue growth at the expense of coherence. A great strategy provides a filter for all decisions: new hires, product lines, acquisitions, partnerships. If an opportunity doesn’t reinforce the core strategic focus, it should be rejected — even if it looks profitable in the short term.\nHe also stresses the importance of empirical validation. Strategy should not be based on wishful thinking, but on observable evidence: where you actually perform best, what your customers truly value, and how your business model behaves under pressure. Vision without data is fantasy.\nFinally, Collins encourages leaders to codify their strategy into a form that everyone can understand — not just the executive team. When strategy is clear, it becomes a language within the company. People at all levels can make better decisions without constant oversight. And when the flywheel of execution begins to spin, it amplifies the force of strategic clarity.\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Innovation\n\nHighlight: Innovation without discipline leads to disaster. Discipline without innovation leads to irrelevance.\nIn this chapter, Collins reframes innovation not as a burst of genius or an act of creative chaos, but as a disciplined, repeatable process. While innovation is essential to sustaining long-term greatness, Collins argues that it is not the starting point for most great companies. Innovation, when successful, is built upon a foundation of clarity — of purpose, values, and strategic focus — and then executed with rigour, not randomness.\nHe begins by dismantling a popular misconception: that the most innovative companies are those that generate the most ideas. In reality, innovation is not about the quantity of ideas but the quality of disciplined experimentation. Collins returns to the concept introduced earlier — “try a lot of stuff and keep what works” — but now applies it in a more mature strategic context. At the heart of this disciplined innovation process is what he calls the “bullets before cannonballs” approach.\nThis metaphor is one of the strongest in the book. It describes how great companies fire low-cost, low-risk bullets — small, testable initiatives — to calibrate aim. Once a bullet hits its target (meaning the idea shows empirical success), they fire a cannonball — scaling up with concentrated resources and confidence. Poorly led companies reverse this sequence. They bet big on untested ideas, wasting time, capital, and often their reputation.\nCollins makes it clear that innovation is not only about new products or technologies. It can be process innovation, business model innovation, cultural innovation — any deliberate change that improves the organisation’s performance or resilience. He also warns against “innovation-as-ego” — when leaders pursue novelty for novelty’s sake, or when they define themselves by their cleverness instead of their results.\nPerhaps most importantly, he emphasises that innovation must serve — not replace — the flywheel. Great companies innovate in ways that amplify what already works, not disrupt themselves with every new fad. Innovation is not the engine. It’s a force-multiplier once your engine is already running well.\nThis chapter ultimately calls for a blend of creativity and discipline. Breakthroughs don’t emerge from chaos; they emerge from well-calibrated curiosity, aligned with strategy and supported by data.\n\n\n\nChapter 9: Tactical Excellence\n\nHighlight: There is nothing more strategic than flawless execution.\nIn this chapter, Collins addresses a theme that’s often neglected in leadership books: the power of executional rigour. While vision, strategy, and innovation get most of the attention, what truly distinguishes enduring companies is their obsession with doing the small things well — over and over again. Tactical excellence, in Collins’s view, is not glamorous. It is not about inspiration. It is about getting the right things done the right way — consistently, at scale.\nHe challenges the false dichotomy between “visionary thinking” and “operational detail,” arguing that great leaders and organisations don’t get to choose between them. They do both. Tactical strength isn’t just for the operations team or middle management — it is a strategic advantage. Companies that execute with discipline gain speed, build trust, and outlast competitors who may have better ideas but weaker delivery.\nOne of the key points in this chapter is that execution is not just about processes and procedures; it’s about culture. In high-performing organisations, discipline becomes habit, and executional excellence becomes a shared norm. People take pride in their work, not because they’re told to, but because it’s who they are as a team. Collins often points to military analogies — elite units don’t succeed through creativity alone, but through flawless execution of well-rehearsed actions, even under pressure.\nHe also explores how sloppiness at the tactical level erodes trust at the leadership level. If leaders tolerate inconsistency in how meetings are run, how feedback is given, how decisions are followed through, they create confusion — and that confusion scales. Tactical sloppiness sends a signal: we are undisciplined. Eventually, that signal becomes cultural identity.\nAnother insight is the idea that discipline and bureaucracy are not the same. Collins is careful to distinguish the two. Bureaucracy arises when people are forced to follow unnecessary rules. Discipline, by contrast, arises when people commit voluntarily to doing what’s right, even when it’s hard or repetitive. The goal is not mindless compliance, but a shared commitment to operational excellence.\nThe chapter closes with a warning and an opportunity: if you don’t build tactical excellence early, you will eventually be forced to — usually under stress, pressure, or crisis. But if you embed it in your culture from the beginning, it becomes a quiet engine of resilience and credibility."
