I have contributed as instructor and teaching assistant in lectures, tutorials, and project-based assignments, with responsibilities ranging from exercise design and student supervision to grading and symposium organisation. These activities allowed me to combine theoretical insights with hands-on problem solving, while engaging closely with MSc students in engineering and systems control.\nIn addition to my past university teaching, I am developing a series of online courses in my areas of expertise — with especial focus on quantitative and financial risk and algorithmic tradings. These courses will soon be available to a broader audience interested in applying rigorous methods to complex, uncertain systems."

The best parts are the vivid case studies: from P&G’s Febreze marketing to Michael Phelps’s visualisation rituals.\nHowever, the book suffers from some repetition, and not every chapter delivers the same insight density. The science is sometimes stretched to fit narrative needs — and there’s limited guidance on what to actually do, beyond “identify your habit loop.”\nStill, it’s essential reading for anyone serious about behaviour change — in life or leadership. Take it more as a framing tool than a behaviour manual."

    "title": "Book Reading Summary – The Power of Habit",
    "section": "Chapters Summary",
    "text": "Chapters Summary\n\nChapter 1: The Habit Loop\n\n“Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.”\n\nThis chapter introduces the cue → routine → reward model of how habits work. Through examples like rats in mazes and people brushing teeth, Duhigg explains that the brain automates behaviour to conserve energy. The key to habit change is identifying the cue and reward, and swapping out the routine.\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The Craving Brain\n\n“Craving is what powers the habit loop.”\n\nDuhigg explores how craving drives habits — it’s not just repetition, but the anticipation of a reward that cements the loop. He illustrates this with P&G’s launch of Febreze and the neurological changes in smokers and gamblers. Marketing often succeeds by attaching emotional cravings to specific cues.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change\n\n“You can’t extinguish a bad habit. You can only change it.”\n\nThis chapter presents the core prescription: keep the same cue and reward, but change the routine. He uses examples like Tony Dungy’s NFL strategy and Alcoholics Anonymous to show that belief and community also reinforce habit rewiring.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Keystone Habits, or The Ballad of Paul O’Neill\n\n“Some habits matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives.”\n\nHere, Duhigg introduces keystone habits — powerful routines that trigger positive ripple effects. The story of Paul O’Neill transforming Alcoa by obsessing over workplace safety shows how one keystone habit can restructure organisational culture.\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Starbucks and the Habit of Success\n\n“Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle.”\n\nThis chapter focuses on willpower as a learnable and exhaustible resource. Duhigg shows how Starbucks trained baristas to handle stress with pre-scripted habits — turning willpower into a routine itself. The same applies to personal habits like budgeting or fitness.\n\n\n\nChapter 6: The Power of a Crisis\n\n“Crises are so valuable, they’re often not wasted.”\n\nOrganisations often only change entrenched habits during crisis. Duhigg shows how hospitals and the London Underground used moments of breakdown to reshape culture and decision-making — because crisis disrupts routine and opens a window for new norms.\n\n\n\nChapter 7: How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do\n\n“Companies are teaching us to crave.”\n\nThis controversial chapter dives into how companies — especially Target — use habit data to predict customer behaviour, often before the customer is consciously aware of it (e.g., pregnancy prediction based on purchase patterns). It raises ethical questions about data, manipulation, and consumer autonomy.\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott\n\n“Movements don’t emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same direction. They rely on social habits.”\n\nThis chapter shifts to social habits — how movements grow through weak ties, peer pressure, and a sense of identity. From Rick Warren’s church-building to the civil rights movement, Duhigg explains how habitual patterns of connection and expectation scale collective action.\n\n\n\nChapter 9: The Neurology of Free Will\n\n“Some habits are so strong, they overpower our will.”\n\nIn this final chapter, Duhigg tackles the tension between habit and responsibility. He describes legal cases (e.g. a sleepwalking murderer, compulsive gamblers) where habit patterns dominate choice. His conclusion: we are responsible for habits once we are aware of them — but not before. Awareness creates agency."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEstimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS9 and CECL requires projecting point–in–time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state–space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non–vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long–run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.\n\nAnchored state-space approach for stable lifetime PD; less drift, less procyclicality. Code and full reproducibility."

    "section": "Chapters Summary",
    "text": "Chapters Summary\n\nChapter 1: Bill and Me\n\nThe purpose of life is not to be happy. The purpose of life is to be useful.\n\nJim Collins opens the book with a heartfelt reflection on his friendship and intellectual partnership with Bill Lazier, co-author of the original Beyond Entrepreneurship. Far from being just a professional collaborator, Lazier was Collins’ mentor, a moral compass, and an enduring example of what it means to lead with character. The chapter is a personal tribute, but also a profound philosophical statement: at the core of great leadership lies not brilliance or ambition, but decency, trustworthiness, and humility.\nThrough anecdotes and quiet observations, Collins illustrates the depth of Bill’s influence. Lazier believed that the greatest currency in business — and in life — is trust. He practiced what he preached, consistently treating others with generosity and respect, even when it cost him personally. Collins credits Lazier with shaping many of the principles that would later become famous in Good to Great and Built to Last, particularly the emphasis on people, values, and long-term integrity over short-term gains.\nThe chapter establishes a central idea: great businesses are built by great people, and great people are shaped by their values, not their titles or credentials. Collins makes clear that this book — BE 2.0 — is not merely an update of a classic, but a deeply personal continuation of a shared legacy. “The purpose of life,” Lazier once told him, “is not to be happy. The purpose of life is to be useful.” That sentiment echoes through the entire book.\n\n\nChapter 2: Great Vision Without Great People Is Irrelevant\n\nIf you have the right people, the problem of how to motivate and manage largely goes away.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins delivers one of his core convictions: that the quality of your people is more important than the brilliance of your vision. A company with an extraordinary vision but the wrong people will fail. A company with average strategy but extraordinary people has a real chance at greatness. This concept, which he later famously summarised as “first who, then what,” emphasises that effective leaders should prioritise assembling the right team before finalising strategy, direction, or product plans.\nCollins urges leaders to ask themselves a simple but powerful question: “Would you hire this person again?” If the answer is no, it’s a sign to act — not necessarily by firing immediately, but by being honest about fit. The right people are not only competent, but also aligned in values, self-motivated, and capable of growing with the organisation. They don’t require constant supervision. Conversely, the wrong people, no matter how talented, create drag — they weaken the culture, confuse the mission, and drain leadership energy.\nImportantly, Collins warns against a common mistake: tolerating mediocrity out of loyalty. Just because someone has been with the company since the beginning doesn’t mean they should stay. Companies that scale with discipline make tough people decisions early. Letting a mismatched team member stay in a key seat can be more damaging than any strategic misstep.\nThe chapter also discusses the danger of keeping “clever but toxic” individuals. High performance is not enough if the behaviour erodes trust or undermines others. A strong culture is not built by a few top performers — it is built by consistency of values across the organisation. In short, leaders must view talent not as a transaction, but as a cultural foundation.\n\n\nChapter 3: Leadership Style\n\nYour leadership style is not what you say it is. It’s what you do consistently, even when no one is watching.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins examines the subtle but critical difference between managing people and leading a culture. The most effective leaders, he argues, don’t impose control — they create the conditions in which people naturally operate with discipline, creativity, and accountability. Leadership, in this sense, is not about style in a superficial or performative way. It’s about what you repeatedly do, what you tolerate, and what you reward — because over time, that becomes your culture.\nThe chapter dismantles the myth of the charismatic, top-down leader. While charisma can inspire short bursts of motivation, it doesn’t scale. What scales is consistency. Collins highlights the power of “clock-building,” a metaphor for creating a self-sustaining, values-driven organisation that runs well without you. Great leaders focus not on being indispensable, but on building systems, people, and processes that are.\nCollins introduces several dimensions of leadership that go beyond traditional “styles” like authoritarian vs participative. He emphasises Level 5 Leadership — a concept expanded in Good to Great — which blends personal humility with fierce resolve. These leaders aren’t loud, but they are unwavering. They’re not the centre of attention, but they set a tone that permeates the organisation. Importantly, they take responsibility for failure and give credit for success.\nAnother key idea is that leaders shape culture through their behavioural example — how they show up in meetings, how they react to bad news, how they listen (or don’t), how they respond under stress. You can’t fake your culture. If you preach values but act contrary to them, people will follow what you do, not what you say.\nFinally, Collins makes a clear distinction between leadership as personality versus leadership as responsibility. True leadership is not about style points — it’s about being the one who takes ownership of creating a culture of excellence and discipline, even when it’s hard or unpopular.\n\n\nChapter 4: Vision\n\nA vision is not what you hope to become. A vision is what you are willing to suffer for.\n\nThis chapter is the philosophical centre of Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0. Collins argues that vision is not a statement — it’s a living system of meaning that drives everything in a company: decisions, culture, strategy, behaviour. A powerful vision doesn’t simply hang on a wall or get recited in meetings. It clarifies why your organisation exists, what you refuse to compromise, and what you’re daring to become.\nCollins breaks down vision into three essential components: core values, core purpose, and BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals). Core values are the non-negotiables — behaviours and principles that you hold onto even when they cost you. He’s quick to note that values don’t need to be universal; they just need to be authentic and lived. Some companies value innovation, others discipline, others humility. What matters is that the values are real and visible in daily actions.\nCore purpose, meanwhile, answers the deeper question: “Why do we exist?” It’s not about profit or growth — those are outcomes. Purpose is the organisation’s reason for being that goes beyond money. When a company loses its purpose, it may still function, but it becomes hollow. Collins compares this to a body without a soul: technically alive, but lacking spirit.\nFinally, BHAGs are long-term, ambitious goals — clear, compelling targets that inspire people to stretch far beyond incremental progress. A good BHAG is audacious but not reckless, emotionally engaging, and measurable enough to know when you’ve achieved it. Importantly, BHAGs work only when they’re grounded in a deep understanding of what your organisation can be great at.\nThroughout the chapter, Collins reinforces that vision isn’t about sounding good — it’s about alignment. The best companies have congruence between what they say, what they believe, and what they do. Vision becomes powerful when it’s operational — when hiring decisions, performance reviews, product choices, and even budget cuts are driven by it.\nThis chapter challenges leaders to get honest: Is your vision just branding language? Or is it a disciplining force in the organisation? Do your people know it? Live it? Care about it? If not, the problem isn’t the words — it’s the leadership behind them.\n\n\nChapter 5: Luck Favors the Persistent\n\nLuck is not a plan. Discipline is.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins tackles the seductive myth that success in business is mostly a matter of good luck — being in the right place at the right time, having the right investor, catching the right market wave. He doesn’t deny that luck exists. In fact, he admits that every great entrepreneur benefits from luck in some form. But he sharply distinguishes between getting luck and returning luck with discipline, preparation, and grit. What ultimately separates those who build enduring companies from those who don’t is not how much luck they get — it’s how they respond to the luck they receive.\nCollins introduces the idea of the “Return on Luck” (ROL) — a concept borrowed from Great by Choice. Two companies might receive the same stroke of luck (a booming market, a competitor imploding, a regulatory tailwind), but one seizes it and amplifies it through disciplined action, while the other squanders it or becomes complacent. In other words, luck is a variable — not a strategy. The entrepreneurs who endure are those who show up every day, stay the course during uncertainty, and are always ready to turn a lucky break into a breakthrough.\nThe chapter features examples of companies and founders who weren’t just lucky — they were relentless. They worked longer, studied harder, failed more often, and got back up faster than others. Collins makes it clear that luck can catalyse a result, but it’s persistence that compounds outcomes over time. He urges readers to build a culture of grit — one where effort, resilience, and preparation are valued as highly as intelligence or creativity.\nHe also issues a warning: people who attribute their failures to bad luck often lack the self-awareness or discipline to grow. Great leaders reflect on their own role in missed opportunities. They ask, “Did we prepare well enough?” or “Did we execute fast enough?” instead of blaming external forces. The best companies track their lucky and unlucky events — and how they responded — as part of their learning culture.\nUltimately, this chapter is about rejecting the lottery mentality and embracing the grind. Enduring greatness is rarely the result of one lucky moment. It is the result of ten thousand unsexy decisions, made with consistency, that put you in a position to benefit when luck finally knocks.\n\n\nChapter 6: What Makes Great Companies Tick – The Map\n\nThe great companies are not built by one thing done right — they are built by a system of interlocking concepts executed with relentless consistency.\n\nIn this pivotal chapter, Collins introduces what he calls The Map — a unifying framework that outlines the essential elements behind all great, enduring companies. The purpose of the chapter is to synthesis the ideas explored in earlier chapters into a coherent, visual and conceptual system. Collins wants readers to stop thinking in isolated traits or silver bullets, and instead understand how the pieces of greatness connect and reinforce each other.\nAt the centre of the map is the idea that greatness comes not from any single variable — not vision, not leadership, not innovation — but from the dynamic interplay of several foundational elements. These include: Level 5 Leadership, First Who, Then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, The Hedgehog Concept, A Culture of Discipline, The Flywheel, Preserve the Core / Stimulate Progress, and Clock Building. Each of these becomes a point on the map — not steps in a process, but interconnected disciplines that reinforce long-term excellence.\nWhat makes the map powerful is its universality. Collins argues that companies of vastly different industries, sizes, and stages can build greatness by adhering to this framework. The elements don’t rely on specific tactics, tools, or technologies. They are principles, and as such, they are durable. Moreover, they are cumulative — organisations don’t become great by mastering one of these principles. They become great by compounding them together, over time, with consistency.\nA central concept here is that of “clock building, not time telling” — the idea that great leaders focus on building enduring systems and cultures, rather than being individual geniuses with one great idea. Similarly, preserve the core and stimulate progress reminds readers that great companies hold tightly to their foundational values, but aggressively evolve everything else to remain relevant and effective.\nThe map is not a checklist or a how-to guide. It’s a way of thinking — a framework for diagnosing the health and direction of your organisation. Collins encourages leaders to ask: Where are we strong? Where are we weak? Which of these disciplines have we truly embedded? Which are only surface-level?\nUltimately, the map serves as a navigation tool — not for finding quick wins, but for building a company that can endure, adapt, and thrive for decades.\n\n\nChapter 7: Strategy\n\nA great strategy is as much about what you don’t do as what you choose to pursue.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins takes direct aim at the mystique of strategy as a high-concept, consultant-driven exercise. He argues that great strategy is not clever — it’s clear. It is not about crafting complex plans or elegant frameworks. Rather, it is about making deliberate choices, grounded in brutal facts, that align with your core values and long-term goals. The hallmark of a strong strategy is not how “smart” it looks on paper, but how actionable it is in practice — and how well it guides decision-making throughout the organisation.\nCollins re-emphasises the importance of what he calls the Hedgehog Concept, introduced in Good to Great. A great strategy sits at the intersection of three things: what you can be the best in the world at, what you are deeply passionate about, and what drives your economic engine. Companies that thrive in the long term are those that define this intersection with brutal honesty — and then commit to it with discipline. Those that fail often chase shiny objects, pivot endlessly, or confuse ambition with focus.\nA key insight in this chapter is that strategy is about saying no. Collins believes that most strategic failures are not due to poor thinking but to a lack of strategic constraint. In other words, companies get distracted. They pursue growth at the expense of coherence. A great strategy provides a filter for all decisions: new hires, product lines, acquisitions, partnerships. If an opportunity doesn’t reinforce the core strategic focus, it should be rejected — even if it looks profitable in the short term.\nHe also stresses the importance of empirical validation. Strategy should not be based on wishful thinking, but on observable evidence: where you actually perform best, what your customers truly value, and how your business model behaves under pressure. Vision without data is fantasy.\nFinally, Collins encourages leaders to codify their strategy into a form that everyone can understand — not just the executive team. When strategy is clear, it becomes a language within the company. People at all levels can make better decisions without constant oversight. And when the flywheel of execution begins to spin, it amplifies the force of strategic clarity.\n\n\nChapter 8: Innovation\n\nInnovation without discipline leads to disaster. Discipline without innovation leads to irrelevance.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins reframes innovation not as a burst of genius or an act of creative chaos, but as a disciplined, repeatable process. While innovation is essential to sustaining long-term greatness, Collins argues that it is not the starting point for most great companies. Innovation, when successful, is built upon a foundation of clarity — of purpose, values, and strategic focus — and then executed with rigour, not randomness.\nHe begins by dismantling a popular misconception: that the most innovative companies are those that generate the most ideas. In reality, innovation is not about the quantity of ideas but the quality of disciplined experimentation. Collins returns to the concept introduced earlier — “try a lot of stuff and keep what works” — but now applies it in a more mature strategic context. At the heart of this disciplined innovation process is what he calls the “bullets before cannonballs” approach.\nThis metaphor is one of the strongest in the book. It describes how great companies fire low-cost, low-risk bullets — small, testable initiatives — to calibrate aim. Once a bullet hits its target (meaning the idea shows empirical success), they fire a cannonball — scaling up with concentrated resources and confidence. Poorly led companies reverse this sequence. They bet big on untested ideas, wasting time, capital, and often their reputation.\nCollins makes it clear that innovation is not only about new products or technologies. It can be process innovation, business model innovation, cultural innovation — any deliberate change that improves the organisation’s performance or resilience. He also warns against “innovation-as-ego” — when leaders pursue novelty for novelty’s sake, or when they define themselves by their cleverness instead of their results.\nPerhaps most importantly, he emphasises that innovation must serve — not replace — the flywheel. Great companies innovate in ways that amplify what already works, not disrupt themselves with every new fad. Innovation is not the engine. It’s a force-multiplier once your engine is already running well.\nThis chapter ultimately calls for a blend of creativity and discipline. Breakthroughs don’t emerge from chaos; they emerge from well-calibrated curiosity, aligned with strategy and supported by data.\n\n\nChapter 9: Tactical Excellence\n\nThere is nothing more strategic than flawless execution.\n\nIn this chapter, Collins addresses a theme that’s often neglected in leadership books: the power of executional rigour. While vision, strategy, and innovation get most of the attention, what truly distinguishes enduring companies is their obsession with doing the small things well — over and over again. Tactical excellence, in Collins’s view, is not glamorous. It is not about inspiration. It is about getting the right things done the right way — consistently, at scale.\nHe challenges the false dichotomy between “visionary thinking” and “operational detail,” arguing that great leaders and organisations don’t get to choose between them. They do both. Tactical strength isn’t just for the operations team or middle management — it is a strategic advantage. Companies that execute with discipline gain speed, build trust, and outlast competitors who may have better ideas but weaker delivery.\nOne of the key points in this chapter is that execution is not just about processes and procedures; it’s about culture. In high-performing organisations, discipline becomes habit, and executional excellence becomes a shared norm. People take pride in their work, not because they’re told to, but because it’s who they are as a team. Collins often points to military analogies — elite units don’t succeed through creativity alone, but through flawless execution of well-rehearsed actions, even under pressure.\nHe also explores how sloppiness at the tactical level erodes trust at the leadership level. If leaders tolerate inconsistency in how meetings are run, how feedback is given, how decisions are followed through, they create confusion — and that confusion scales. Tactical sloppiness sends a signal: we are undisciplined. Eventually, that signal becomes cultural identity.\nAnother insight is the idea that discipline and bureaucracy are not the same. Collins is careful to distinguish the two. Bureaucracy arises when people are forced to follow unnecessary rules. Discipline, by contrast, arises when people commit voluntarily to doing what’s right, even when it’s hard or repetitive. The goal is not mindless compliance, but a shared commitment to operational excellence.\nThe chapter closes with a warning and an opportunity: if you don’t build tactical excellence early, you will eventually be forced to — usually under stress, pressure, or crisis. But if you embed it in your culture from the beginning, it becomes a quiet engine of resilience and credibility."

My background spans both academic research and financial industry practice, giving me a unique perspective on how rigorous theory can be transformed into practical solutions for real-world challenges.\nI hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Control Systems Engineering from Delft University of Technology, where I focused on optimisation, stochastic modelling, and distributed control of large-scale systems such as energy and infrastructure networks. After my PhD, I continued as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Groningen, where my work centred on advanced methods in optimisation, learning, and decision-making in uncertain environments.\nIn parallel to my academic career, I have spent the last five years as a Senior Quantitative Analyst in banking, working at leading financial institutions in Zürich and Amsterdam. My focus has been on model risk management, credit and impairment modelling, and regulatory compliance frameworks such as IFRS 9, CECL, and stress testing. This experience has strengthened my ability to build bridges between advanced mathematical models, regulatory expectations, and practical business needs.\nToday, my research and professional interests converge around stochastic modelling, optimisation, and risk management across domains such as energy systems, financial markets, and infrastructure planning. I am particularly driven by the question of how mathematical models, data-driven methods, and economic principles can be combined to design robust, transparent, and scalable decision frameworks for uncertain and dynamic environments.\nBeyond my professional work, I enjoy building new ideas into projects, from smart energy applications for electric vehicles to risk and pricing frameworks for decentralised finance. At heart, I am motivated by curiosity, collaboration, and the ambition to create tools that not only solve technical problems but also contribute to more resilient systems for the future."

This work addresses regulatory requirements (IFRS 9, CECL) while providing more stable and transparent credit risk measures. It reflects my broader interest in connecting stochastic state-space models with practical risk assessment frameworks used in banking.\n\nBook Project: Quantitative Interview Questions (QIQ)\n\nI am authoring a book that brings together quantitative finance, probability, and statistics into a practical guide for professionals preparing for technical interviews. The book combines rigorous exercises with clear explanations, covering topics from risk modelling and stochastic processes to applied coding tasks. My aim is to create not just a collection of questions, but a structured learning resource that builds both technical mastery and intuition."

    "section": "Chapters Summary",
    "text": "Chapters Summary\n\nChapter 1: The Challenge of the Future\n\nBrilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.\n\nThis chapter opens with the book’s central thesis: the future isn’t inevitable — we can shape it. Thiel introduces the distinction between horizontal progress (going from 1 to n, copying what works) and vertical progress (going from 0 to 1, doing something truly new). He argues that while globalisation is valuable, it’s not enough — the real breakthroughs come from technology and original thinking. The most important task of the 21st-century entrepreneur is to discover and create something new. Innovation is rare, but it’s the only way to build a better future.\n\n\nChapter 2: Party Like It’s 1999\n\nLeanness is a methodology, not a goal. Boldness builds value.\n\nThiel revisits the dot-com crash and critiques the tech bubble mindset. He explains how four dangerous lessons were mistakenly learned by that generation of founders:\n\nMake incremental advances.\nStay lean and flexible.\nImprove on the competition.\nFocus on product, not sales.\n\nHe argues these became dogma — but they are often wrong. Instead, Thiel encourages founders to build bold visions, avoid direct competition, and aim for monopoly. Playing it safe is the riskiest strategy of all.\n\n\nChapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different\n\nAll failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.\n\nIn this chapter, Thiel presents his most famous and provocative idea:\n\n“Competition is for losers.”\n\nGreat businesses are monopolies — they do something so well that no one else can offer a close substitute. Bad businesses fight to survive in commoditised markets. He explains that monopolies aren’t evil — they enable companies to focus on long-term innovation and customer value. Meanwhile, competitive businesses are too busy fighting over scraps to innovate meaningfully.\n\n\nChapter 4: The Ideology of Competition\n\nIf you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already more sane than most.\n\nThiel explores how society idolises competition — in schools, sports, and business — despite its destructive consequences. He argues that competition narrows thinking, distorts incentives, and causes people to chase validation rather than value. Entrepreneurs, in contrast, must learn to ignore competitors and focus on building something no one else can. If you’re constantly reacting to others, you’re not leading — you’re following.\n\n\nChapter 5: Last Mover Advantage\n\nThe most successful companies make the last great development in a specific market — and enjoy decades of monopoly profits.\n\nHere Thiel challenges the idea that first-mover advantage is crucial. In fact, being first is not what matters — it’s being the last company to dominate a space. He outlines four key characteristics of lasting monopolies:\n\nProprietary technology\nNetwork effects\nEconomies of scale\nBranding\n\nFounders should think strategically about how to scale defensibly and become the “last mover” — the company that owns the market, not just enters it.\n\n\nChapter 6: You Are Not a Lottery Ticket\n\nIndefinite attitudes to the future explain what’s most dysfunctional in our world today.\n\nThiel criticises the popular belief that success is mostly about chance. He promotes a worldview of definite optimism — the belief that the future can be planned and shaped. He contrasts this with indefinite optimism (hope without a plan), definite pessimism (planning for decline), and indefinite pessimism (drift and cynicism). The best founders reject randomness. They plan, commit, and build with purpose.\n\n\nChapter 7: Follow the Money\n\nThe biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.\n\nThis chapter explains the power law in startups — the idea that a tiny number of companies generate nearly all the returns. Whether in venture capital, personal careers, or startup impact, the rule holds: most things fail, and the few successes dominate. Thiel urges founders and investors to focus obsessively on the one thing that could yield outsized results. Diversification, he says, is often just disguised ignorance.\n\n\nChapter 8: Secrets\n\nThe best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.\n\nThiel believes there are still undiscovered truths about the world — what he calls “secrets.” The key to entrepreneurship is finding something valuable that nobody else sees. Thiel splits secrets into secrets of nature (scientific or technical) and secrets of people (hidden social insights). Conventional wisdom says everything has been discovered. Great founders reject that. They look where others aren’t looking and ask: What valuable company is nobody building?\n\n\nChapter 9: Foundations\n\nA startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.\n\nThis chapter deals with the most overlooked part of a startup: founding decisions. Equity splits, culture, cofounder alignment — all these are critical, and mistakes here are very hard to fix later. Thiel stresses founder unity, clarity of vision, and tightly aligned incentives. A weak foundation, even with a good idea, often leads to conflict, stagnation, or collapse.\n\n\nhapter 10: The Mechanics of Mafia\n\nYou can’t outsource culture. You must build it — brick by brick, belief by belief.\n\nThiel describes how successful startups operate like tight-knit mafias — intensely mission-driven teams with shared values and long-term loyalty. He contrasts this with bureaucratic corporations, where people clock in and out without connection. The goal is to build a team that believes in the vision so strongly, they’d rather work there than anywhere else. Culture, he argues, is not a soft asset — it’s a competitive advantage.\n\n\nChapter 11: If You Build It, Will They Come?\n\nSuperior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation.\n\nHere Thiel dismantles the myth that “great products sell themselves.” They don’t. Every startup needs a distribution strategy — a way to reach customers. He categorises sales into complex, personal, automated, and viral channels, explaining which work for which kinds of products. Without distribution, even the best technology fails. “Poor distribution — not poor product — is the number one cause of failure.”\n\n\nChapter 12: Man and Machine\n\nBetter technology lets people do more, not less.\n\nThis chapter responds to fears about artificial intelligence. Thiel rejects the “man vs machine” narrative and proposes a man + machine model. The best systems amplify human strengths, rather than replace them. He cites Palantir as an example — software that helps humans make better decisions, rather than making decisions for them. The best startups build complementary intelligence, not competition.\n\n\nChapter 13: Seeing Green\n\nThe seven questions every business must answer are unforgiving — ignore even one, and you’re likely to fail.\n\nIn this case study chapter, Thiel analyses the clean tech bubble and why most green startups failed. He identifies seven questions every startup must answer:\n\nEngineering\nTiming\nMonopoly\nPeople\nDistribution\nDurability\nSecret\n\nCleantech companies ignored many of these — especially monopoly and distribution — and paid the price. This framework is a diagnostic tool for judging startup viability.\n\n\nChapter 14: The Founder’s Paradox\n\nA unique founder can make a unique company. But uniqueness is a double-edged sword.\n\nIn the final chapter, Thiel wrestles with the idea that founders often need to be extreme personalities. Society wants balance, but transformative companies are usually built by unbalanced, intense, eccentric individuals. This is a paradox: the very traits that make founders dangerous also make them powerful. The challenge is to channel extremism into long-term impact — without burning everything down."

Such problems arise naturally in energy, finance, and engineering applications, yet their scenario approximations often suffer from looseness and unpredictable duality gaps.\nWe reformulate the scenario problem using a set-valued perspective, where feasibility is represented as the Minkowski sum of per-scenario sets. By combining Aumann expectations with a law of large numbers for random sets, we establish convergence properties of these sums. Applying a Shapley–Folkman convexification argument, we derive explicit bounds on the duality gap.\nFor chance-constrained problems, the duality gap is shown to be uniformly bounded by a constant depending only on dimension. For expectation-constrained problems, the gap vanishes at rate O(1/N) with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate these asymptotic behaviours and reveal the distinct roles of chance versus expectation constraints in shaping feasible regions.\nResearch significance\nThese results offer one of the first rigorous analyses of scenario methods in nonconvex optimisation. They demonstrate that despite nonconvexity, scenario approximations can achieve provable stability, either through bounded or vanishing duality gaps. This advances the mathematical foundations of risk-aware optimisation with implications for portfolio design, energy systems, and engineering control.\n\nTheme: Stochastic optimisation, scenario methods, convexification\n\nInstitution: Joint work with Akiko Takeda (University of Tokyo) and Takafumi Kanamori (Institute of Science Tokyo)\n\nStatus: In preparation for submission to SIAM Journal on Optimization (SIOPT)\n\nKeywords: Duality gap, random sets, Shapley–Folkman theorem, chance constraints, expectation constraints\n\nOutcomes\n\nIntroduced a scenario convexification framework for analysing stochastic nonconvex programmes.\n\nDerived dimension-dependent uniform bounds for chance-constrained problems.\n\nProved vanishing duality gaps for expectation-constrained problems with rate O(1/N).\n\nProvided numerical evidence supporting theoretical asymptotics.\n\nHighlighted outputs\n\nWorking paper: Vanishing Duality Gap in Uncertain Nonconvex Problems (with A.

A recurring challenge is that macroeconomic forecast errors accumulate when projecting transition matrices over long horizons, leading to volatile and procyclical PD term structures.\nThis project reformulates the problem in a state–space framework, where term structure dynamics are estimated with a Kalman filter. We show that the standard filter leaves non-vanishing variability, failing to stabilise long-run PD paths. To address this, we introduce an anchored observation model that incorporates a neutral long-run economic state into the filtering process. This adjustment ensures asymptotic stochastic stability, providing convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure.\nResearch significance\nThis project advances the reliability of credit risk modelling under IFRS 9 and CECL by addressing one of its core weaknesses: unstable and procyclical lifetime PD term structures. By embedding PD estimation in a state–space framework and introducing anchored observation models, the work provides a mathematically rigorous solution that ensures stochastic stability. Beyond theory, the approach directly supports banks and regulators in producing smoother, more interpretable projections of credit risk, reducing model risk and enhancing comparability across economic cycles.\n\nTheme: Credit risk, IFRS 9 / CECL, model stability\n\nInstitution: Independent research (in collaboration with industry applications)\n\nStatus: Working paper, simulation package, GitHub repository\n\nKeywords: Risk modelling, stochastic stability, state–space methods\n\n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\nDemonstrated that forecast noise can be substantially reduced by anchoring the observation model.\n\nDerived conditions for stochastic stability of PD term structures under filtering.\n\nDeveloped a simulation package illustrating effects on synthetic corporate portfolios.\n\nProduced smoother, more interpretable PD projections, with direct implications for regulatory model risk management.\n\nHighlighted outputs\n\nWorking paper: Anchored Kalman Filtering for Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty (submitted to the Journal of Credit Risk).\n\nGitHub repository with simulation package.\n\narXiv preprint: arXiv:2509.10586."

The central idea was that multi-carrier infrastructures — such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, hybrid heat pumps, Power-to-Gas, and Gas-to-Power conversion — can significantly improve efficiency and flexibility if supported by the right control strategies and market mechanisms.\nMy work focused on mathematical modelling, stochastic optimisation, and distributed control design. I studied how uncertainty in renewable generation and end-user demand propagates across coupled infrastructures, and how incentive schemes and control algorithms can align decentralised actors with system-level goals. This included developing model predictive control (MPC) formulations that balance flexibility, efficiency, and reliability, while explicitly accounting for financial and operational risks.\n\nTheme: Electricity–gas–heat coupling, incentives, and control\nInstitution: University of Groningen (with partners: Alliander, Enexis, TNO)\nFunding: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)\nPeriod: Sep 2018 – Dec 2019\n\nOutcomes:\n\nDemonstrated how coupling gas and electricity systems can improve integration of renewable energy while maintaining security of supply.\nProposed stochastic MPC frameworks with risk measures (e.g., CVaR) to better manage demand flexibility under uncertainty.\nDesigned distributed algorithms for building-to-grid integration and frequency support services.\nProvided simulation tools to evaluate multi-carrier energy scenarios, supporting both academic and industrial partners.\n\nHighlighted Publications:\n\nJ.

The project envisions a tokenised hedge fund where investors contribute to a managed pool and receive a native token representing their share. Unlike many existing DeFi products, ZWMCo emphasises transparent risk management, leveraging methods from quantitative finance such as liquidity stress testing, stochastic control, and scenario analysis.\nThe system integrates two main components:\n\nAlgorithmic trading (AVS-based): A suite of strategies built on Adaptive Volatility Scaling (AVS) principles. These strategies dynamically adjust exposure across crypto assets, balancing risk and return under changing volatility regimes.\n\nLSDx framework: A research-driven risk and pricing model for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs).

The project builds on my expertise in stochastic optimisation and risk pooling to design a system where EV users can “lock in” charging prices over a future horizon. By aggregating user demand and leveraging hedging strategies, the platform provides predictable energy costs while balancing risk across the pool.\nThe innovation lies in combining behavioural modelling with financial risk techniques: users interact through a simple app, but underneath, advanced optimisation allocates risk, manages variability, and aligns incentives. Beyond pricing, ChargePool also integrates route planning, station availability, and points of interest, turning EV charging into a more seamless mobility experience.\nResearch significance\nChargePool represents a direct application of stochastic modelling and incentive design to consumer-facing energy systems. By bridging academic methods and entrepreneurial deployment, it illustrates how optimisation and risk management can create new markets for flexibility and predictability in the energy transition.\nTheme: Energy systems, behavioural economics, pricing optimisation\nInstitution: Independent initiative (with prospective industry partners in Switzerland)\nStatus: Proof-of-concept (submitted for BRIDGE funding), prototype app in development\nKeywords: EV charging, risk pooling, smart pricing, behavioural modelling\nOutcomes\n\nDesigned a risk pooling engine that stabilises charging costs for users.\n\nDeveloped a prototype app for route planning and charging station selection.\n\nSubmitted a BRIDGE Proof-of-Concept proposal hosted at ETH Zürich (Automatic Control Lab).\n\nInitiated discussions with Swiss energy and mobility partners (e.g., GoFast, Swisscard, Energy360).\n\nHighlighted outputs\n\nProject description and pitch material (BRIDGE PoC 2025 submission).\n\nEarly prototype code and simulation results (private GitHub repository)."
